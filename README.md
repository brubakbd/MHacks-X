# Foodphoria Backend
This repo contains the database management and backend for Foodphoria. `Backend.py` contains the main flask code running the backend and handling client requests. `Util.py` and `train.py` contain the bulk of the code for our machine learning using Tensorflow and Keras.

To run the application:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`python backend.py`
